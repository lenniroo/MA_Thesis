## Can Online Hate Speech Predict Offline Hate Crime? A German Twitter Investigation 

Under the cloak of anonymity, users of social media platforms can spread their hate
against each other. This can also effect offline life as committed hate crime. To perpetrate
this, users get radicalized in online echochambers. So, users undergo a cognitive
process of three steps in closed, highly linked, and dense social networks: normalization
of hate, acclimation, and dehumanization of others. Since at least two right-wing
extremist attacks were shared via livestream at social media platforms, I will investigate,
if online hate speech on Twitter can predict offline hate crime against refugees.
Therefore, I scrape German Tweets from 2015 until the end of 2020 and apply an SVM
algorithm to classify hate speech. Subsequently, I develop a forecasting model based on
detected hate speech to predict offline hate crime on a federal state-level in Germany.
