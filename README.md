## Can Online Hate Speech Predict Offline Hate Crime? A German Twitter Investigation 

Abstract. Under the coat of anonymity, users of social media platforms can spread their hate
against each other and/or minorities. This can also effect offline life. For instance, the right-wing
extremist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand (10/2019), and Hanau, Germany (02/2020). This
can be explained by the theory of radicalization. At this people undergo a cognitive process of
three steps: normalization of hate (e.g. against minorities), acclimation, and dehumanization of
others (e.g. minorities). At this process, one is sliding deeper and deeper in an echochamber.
Therefore, I try to answer the research question; if Twitter hate speech can predict offline hate
crime. For this I scrape German Tweets from 01/01/2015 until 12/31/2020 and apply a SVM
algorithm with sentiment analysis features to classify hate speech. Subsequently, I develop a
forecasting model based on the detected hate speech to predict offline hate crime.
